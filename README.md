A Blackjack application written C#.  I made this mostly as a review for myself, since it's been awhile since I've done OOB programming and reviewing C#.  
But the application works just like any other game of black jack keep betting until you run out of money (or exit the application).  Splits are not included though.  
The program also saves progress upon exiting (through the application not closing it).  
Now the real question is will you win big or lose?  Remember 99.9% gamblers quit right before their big win.
